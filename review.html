                <h5>&#9733&#9733&#9733&#9733&#189</h5>
                <p>There are some moments from A Visit From the Goon Squad that I won’t forget. <br>In one chapter,
                    a former PR hotshot named Dolly is tasked with reviving the public<br>image of an African
                    dictator known as “The General” with the help of a B-list actress<br> named Kitty Jackson.
                    Kitty’s job is to stand next to The General in a photo, but she <br>ends up asking too many
                    questions about a genocide and gets thrown into prison. <br>Months later, it turns out, The
                    General’s government becomes a democracy, Kitty<br> is freed, and Dolly opens a sandwich shop.
                    This strand of Egan’s polyphonic, <br>funny, and often poignant book encapsulates some of her
                    satire’s recurring ideas.</p>

                <h5>&#9733&#9733&#9733&#9733&#9733</h5>
                <p>It is easier to conjure the intellectual-literary atmosphere of an era when it is 30 years’
                    <br>past than when it is a mere decade ago. It is hard to see 2010 right now, as we wait for
                    <br> time and the canon to true the lens, but I have a very clear sense-memory of revelation
                    <br>and exhilaration as I sped through David Mitchell’s epic-historical ghost story, The
                    <br>Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, wondering if the spirit of Robert Louis Stevenson <br>
                    had momentarily taken possession of Haruki Murakami. Here was a reminder that the <br> world of
                    a novel—in this case, a very detailed rendering of an 18th-century Dutch trading <br>post in the
                    port of Nagasaki—can be fuller, more vivid, than our own, that it can exist as a <br>hothouse
                    for the reader’s moral imagination.

                <h5>&#9733&#9733&#9733&#189</h5>
                <p>Julie Otsuka’s groundbreaking (and PEN/Faulkner Award-winning) Buddha In the <br>Attic begins:
                    “On the boat we were mostly virgins. We had long black hair and flat <br>wide feet and we were
                    not very tall. Some of us had eaten nothing but rice gruel as <br>young girls and had slightly
                    bowed legs, and some of us were fourteen years old and <br>were still young girls ourselves.”
                    This is how we are introduced to our narrators, a <br>group of Japanese “picture brides.” We
                    follow them as they immigrate to California. <br>We watch helplessly as they meet the husbands
                    they were promised to, as they attempt <br>to assimilate to America and raise children across a
                    cultural divide. </p>

                <p>Although it came out in 2011, I read The Tiger’s Wife, the elegant first novel by <br>Téa Obreht,
                    only recently. I found it stunning, so perfectly moving on its many <br>levels. Obreht’s
                    protagonist and narrator, a young doctor named Natalia whose <br>life is upended by the
                    mysterious death of her beloved grandfather, is one of the <br>most mellifluous, engrossing
                    storytellers I’ve encountered in my life (she has <br>learned well—her grandfather is one of the
                    most mellifluous, engrossing story- <br>-tellers she has encountered in hers).</p>

                <p>Most of what remains with me years after reading Jesmyn Ward’s second novel <br> is
                    impressionistic. One of the final images in Salvage the Bones is of the 14- <br>year-old
                    protagonist Esche’s father roughing out the initial impact of Hurricane <br>Katrina in the attic
                    of their flooded house. They’ve been separated from the <br>family dog, China, and her litter of
                    puppies; Esche’s dad resolves to stay there <br>until China returns. Ward’s story is largely
                    about caretaking; the slimness of the <br>book and the small-scale—a father and his children
                    prepare for a hurricane that <br>people are warning about—belie the immensity of what Ward set
                    out to do with <br>this National Book Award-winning novel.</p>

                    My Puny Sorrows runs the gamut of emotions. Miriam Toews <br>will have you laughing out loud one
                    minute and sobbing on the subway the <br>next. Her novel tells the story of Elf and Yoli, two
                    sisters with an incredible <br>bond despite living very different lives. By all external
                    trappings, Elf is the <br>successful sister. She is a world-renowned virtuoso pianist. She’s
                    wealthy <br>and happily married. Yoli is not any of those things. Instead, she is struggling
                    <br>with how to love someone who no longer wants to live. And so here we find <br>ourselves, in
                    the room with these two inseparable sisters in the aftermath of <br> Elf’s suicide attempt.

                    <br>each one a jolt of intelligence or feeling.
